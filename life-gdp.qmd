# Life Expectancy and GDP per Capita

In this analysis, we examine the relationship between life expectancy and GDP per capita across countries using the Gapminder dataset. Typically, higher GDP per capita is associated with longer life expectancy, indicating better living conditions and healthcare.

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
gapminder <- read.csv("gapminder.csv")

# Create a scatter plot of life expectancy vs GDP per capita
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdp_per_capita, y = life_expectancy)) +

  geom_smooth(method = "loess") +

    x = "GDP per Capita (log scale)",
    y = "Life Expectancy"
  )
