# Life Expectancy and Population

In this analysis, we explore the relationship between life expectancy and population size using the Gapminder dataset. This relationship helps to understand how population dynamics might affect or reflect changes in life expectancy over time.

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
gapminder <- read.csv("gapminder.csv")

# Create a scatter plot of life expectancy vs population
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = population_millions, y = life_expectancy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess") +
  labs(
    title = "Relationship Between Life Expectancy and Population",
    x = "Population (millions)",
    y = "Life Expectancy"
  )
